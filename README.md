## Features
### Choose your background
Just like my previous [dialogue sandbox](https://github.com/lezzthanthree/SIFAS-Dialogue-Sandbox), you can choose a background found from Project Sekai!

You can also upload your own background to match your story perfectly.

### Customize the dialogue
Type the dialogues of who's speaking and adjust their font size to match their tone!

### Live2D Models as your sprites!

With their Live2D Models, you can use them as your sprite and choose your perfect poses and emotions to the character of your choosing!

Or, you could upload your own normal PNG Sprite! It's your own choice!
